- Added `vello_svg::append`, which takes an svg string and renders to a provided vello scene.
- Added `vello_svg::append_with`, which takes an svg string and renders to a provided vello scene with and error handler.
- Added `vello_svg::render_tree`, which takes a usvg::Tree and renders to a provided vello scene with and error handler.

### Changed

- Updated to vello 0.2
